# Ardan
Ardan is an experimental proof-of-concept research platform for simulating a Cyber-Physical System in Virtual Reality using the Unreal Engine and Cooja Wireless Sensor Network simulator. 

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the viability of and benefits of using an advanced 3D game engine to provide a virtual world capable of simulating the environment, physics, lighting and people, for a simulated CPS to operate in.

The platform is composed of two parts:
 - The UE4 plugin/logic/models, which handles the virtual hardware representations, game logic and networking code.
 - Cooja simulator plugin, which handles communicating with the simulated nodes and updating the simulated state.
